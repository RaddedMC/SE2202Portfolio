                    <p>This project is so massive that pictures can't explain it all, so I'll release a video detailing everything in the near future. In the meantime, have Madeline sitting on my Google Home. Essentially, I converted my student rental into a smart home using consumer-ready tech and DIY parts. We have Philips Hue and other smart lights, security cameras, Google Home/Nest speakers, AirPlay/Chromecast, door sensors, motion sensors, Logitech Harmony, and so much more. There is RGB literally everywhere and it actually has functional use: as an example, the lights in the bedrooms flash red when the front door is opened. We have Ubiquiti WiFi which our home to see who's at home (based on mobile phone WiFi), and can run automations based on their presence, or lack thereof. This is just a small portion of what we have built and we're constantly adding new things, which is why the video hasn't been released yet.</p>

                    <p>As part of a massive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZJlrbdYh-M&t=540s">rebrand of my YouTube</a> channel to make it fit better with my university life, Radiant was meant to be an absurdly overkill video intro that I would use for years and years. I use the files to create snippets of my 3D character for video thumbnails as well! The video demoing the intro got copyright-claimed so I can't embed it to this website. See the link above! The original intro video also took 6 hours to render on five gaming laptops :D</p>

                    <p>What started as a way for me to upcycle a nice-looking old digital photo frame turned into a massive, modular project that I still consider to be my coding magnum opus. Using Python, a Raspberry Pi and modular "plugins", SmartFrame is able to grab data from all of your favourite services like: Philips Hue, Spotify, the weather, your calendar, YouTube, your local network and NAS, COVID case data, and many others! It uses this data to create a clean infoboard that can be displayed on any screen that understands what a .jpg file is.</p>

                    <p>Winner of best domain name at Hack Western 8, Boom or Doom was my first hackathon project. Using <a href="https://dasha.ai/en-us">event sponsor Dasha.ai</a>, we attempted to cold-call the entire city of London, Ontario with a quiz and show the results on a website. While the program was fully functional, we ran into timing issues while collecting calls: very few call recipients actually answered! Due to Amazon Web Services fees, the website had to be shut down, but the video demo is still up.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to build a file server and had this console lying around. Using custom firmware, I installed Linux on my old PlayStation 3. As seen in the photo, it fully boots and functions. However there were certain limitations that prevented this installation from being viable for its original use as a home server, most notably the console's 256 MB of ram and the fact that the console's GPU doesn't work in linux. Also, the Linux installation tools partitioned only 10 GB to Linux, too small for use in a file server.</p>
